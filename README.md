# About me:
I'm a person with infinite amounts of focus if the project is interesting, and I absolutely love what I do. I've played around mostly as a Back-end developer, but I've got decent Data Engineering skills. In my current job I work as both a back-end .Net Developer and as a Data Engineer, mostly depending on what project I'm doing: I work with the Data management part of my company as a Data Engineer, however I have a great amount of freedom to develop new tools/solutions if I find that they're needed. Most of my commit history is unfortunately on a private gitlab, however every now and then I'll test technologies or fun projects over here on Github.
# Technology Stacks

.Net Core for Desktop, Web, and API Development

Apache Airflow, Apache Hop for building an autonomous Data Pipeline.

Also overall open-source enthusiast.
